 * GenosDB service — the app's entire data, P2P sync and persistence layer.
 *
 * Replaces the former Gun-based service: manual namespacing, relay probing,
 * WebSocket health tracking, RAM eviction and flood throttling are all gone.
 * GenosDB provides scoped OPFS storage, Nostr-based signaling and reactive
 * queries natively — so this file is the single initialization point.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { db } from '@/services/gdbServices';
 *   const id = await db.put({ type: 'poll', question: '...' });
 *   await db.map({ query: { type: 'poll' } }, ({ id, value, action }) => { ... });

// of letting the bundler split + hash it — which would scatter the siblings and
// break that relative resolution. The folder is served from node_modules in dev and
// copied verbatim into the build by the `genosdb-static` plugin in vite.config.ts.
