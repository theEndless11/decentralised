# Views — `src/views/`

> **Keep this file updated** whenever you add, remove, or significantly change a view.

Route-level pages built with Vue 3 Composition API + Ionic. Views compose stores, services, and reusable components into complete screens.

## View Inventory

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HomePage.vue` | Mixed home feed that combines communities, posts, and polls with new-content banners and runtime relay-aware loading. On mount it expands visible feed size up to an initial 50-item target, and it auto-expands again when newly loaded posts/polls arrive (up to that same cap), so fetched content is visible without first scrolling. It still uses incremental infinite-scroll loading beyond the cap. The background DM preview list now merges room discovery, listeners, and unread counting across both legacy `chats/*` and mirrored `v3/chats/*` roots so direct-message history is not split during migration. Includes detailed `[FeedDebug]` console diagnostics for warmup/subscription/render count tracing (enabled only when `localStorage.interpoll_feed_debug === 'true'`). |
| `CommunityPage.vue` | Community detail page with feed, metadata, and join/share actions. In the mixed `all` filter, it now promotes one poll near the top when polls are present but would otherwise be buried below many posts, so polls are visible without deep scrolling. On direct route reloads it now performs a short `communityStore.loadCommunities()` bootstrap before selecting the community to reduce cold-start misses, and emits detailed `[CommunityDebug]` loading logs when `localStorage.interpoll_community_debug === 'true'`. |
| `PollDetailPage.vue` | Full poll page with inline vote submission, results gating, duplicate-vote checks, and receipt-first submission flow. After `chainStore.addVote()` succeeds it marks the vote locally, routes to the receipt immediately, and lets backend confirm plus Gun/MySQL follow-up sync continue in the background so slow or outdated relays do not bounce the user back into a second submission attempt. |
| `VotePage.vue` | Standalone vote route that loads a poll by id and renders `VoteForm.vue`; used for direct links and receipt-oriented vote flows. |
| `ReceiptPage.vue` | Displays a previously generated mnemonic receipt and linked vote details from the local chain. |
| `ResultsPage.vue` | Dedicated poll results page for viewing vote counts without the voting form. |
| `SearchView.vue` | Search page for posts and polls; now relies on runtime relay config instead of capturing a fixed API base at mount time. |
| `ChatView.vue` | Route-reactive direct-chat page that reinitializes when the target peer changes without forcing a full page reload. |
| `JoinPrivatePage.vue` | Invite / private-community entry flow. Supports SPA navigation without a browser reload. |
| `SettingsPage.vue` | Runtime relay settings, diagnostics, and local app configuration. Network tab includes explicit bootstrap recovery (generate/copy/import bootstrap artifacts, Gun discovery seeding, probe-before-switch confirmation) plus known-server trust/freshness metadata (`local`/`peer`/`gun` source, signature status, TTL when provided). “Signed” reflects explicit verification state, not source labels. Generated bootstrap invites now also include optional browser handoff context (source peer id, connected server endpoint, and snapshot status counters such as posts/polls/block height), and import prompts surface that context while still requiring manual confirmation. Relay switching is blocked for offline probe results. “Currently connected” reflects the live open WebSocket URL, not config URL match alone. |
| `CreatePollPage.vue` | Poll composer route. Post action now exposes an explicit submit-in-progress state (`Posting…`) and validation toast messaging for incomplete form input, so users no longer see a silent no-op when required fields are missing or while the create request is in-flight. It also emits opt-in submit diagnostics when `localStorage.interpoll_poll_debug` includes `ui` (or `all`), so console logs can trace payload prep, create completion/failure, and total submit duration. |

## Notes

- These are route components; internal links should stay inside the SPA router rather than using full-page reloads.
- Poll voting UX is designed to prioritize the decentralized chain write and receipt generation. Relay-side confirmation and denormalized poll counters are follow-up sync tasks, not the success condition for the vote itself.
