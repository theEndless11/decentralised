# Stores — `src/stores/`

> **Keep this file updated** whenever you add, remove, or change a store.

All stores use the **Composition API form** of Pinia: `defineStore('name', () => { ... })`. Views/components consume stores; they do not call services directly.

## `chainStore.ts` — `useChainStore`

The most critical store. Owns the local blockchain.

- **Init**: Call `chainStore.initialize()` once on app start. It calls `BroadcastService.initialize()`, `RelayManager.initialize()`, `WebSocketService.initialize()`, `ChainService.initializeChain()`, then wires sync listeners for both channels.
- **Sync protocol**: On connect, sends `request-sync` with `lastIndex` (incremental — only fetches missing blocks). Responds to `sync-response` by validating and appending blocks. Conflict resolution: same index + different hash → ignore remote block (local chain wins). Live `new-block` deliveries also short-circuit when the parent hash does not match the current local head, avoiding noisy validation failures for competing branches.
- **Voting**: `addVote(vote)` → creates block → broadcasts on both channels → saves receipt → calls `AuditService.logReceipt`.
- **Actions**: `addAction(actionType, data, label)` records non-vote events (community creation, post creation) as blocks.
- **Nostr events**: Every vote also creates and broadcasts a signed Nostr event via `EventService`.

## `pollStore.ts` — `usePollStore`

Manages polls loaded from GunDB and cross-tab vote updates.

- Polls are keyed in a `Map<string, Poll>` for O(1) lookups.
- Subscribes to GunDB per community. Subscription lifecycle managed with `subscribedCommunities` + `unsubscribers` map — call `unsubscribe(communityId)` to clean up.
- During subscription updates, if an incoming poll patch is missing `communityId` but an existing cached poll has it, the store preserves the existing `communityId` to prevent the poll from disappearing from community-filtered views due to partial Gun records.
- Community poll loads now avoid treating local fallback cache as proof of an active live subscription: stale subscription state is cleaned and re-subscribed unless both subscription bookkeeping and community polls are already live, so network updates/deletes are not missed.
- Uses per-community initial-load tracking (`initialLoadDoneByCommId`) to avoid cross-community false "new poll" classification.
- `pendingNewPolls` only contains truly new arrivals after initial hydration; `flushNewPolls()` moves them into `pollsMap` and persists seen IDs in localStorage.
- Pagination: `visibleCount` incremented by `PAGE_SIZE` (10).
- `createPoll()` checks the current user's `showRealName` preference. Same pseudonym-vs-real-name logic as posts.
- After a successful `voteOnPoll()`, the store reloads the canonical poll from `PollService.loadPoll()` and then broadcasts `poll-updated` over both `BroadcastService` and `WebSocketService` so local tabs and online peers converge on the same Gun-backed totals immediately.

## `communityStore.ts` — `useCommunityStore`

- Has a **MySQL REST fallback** via the gun-relay's `/db/search?prefix={namespace}/communities` endpoint, but only when the active namespace is `v2` or lower. In `v3+` clean-slate mode, this fallback is intentionally skipped so empty Gun namespaces stay empty.
- `selectCommunity()` follows the same rule: `/db/soul` fallback is v2-only, so v3+ does not trigger cross-origin fallback requests when Gun has no matching community yet.
- The fallback relay base URL is derived from runtime config (`config.relay.gun`), not hardcoded, so Settings relay overrides and localhost/dev relays are respected.
- Fallback `/db/search` and `/db/soul` reads are timeboxed to avoid hanging community navigation when fallback relay requests are slow or blocked.
- MySQL post warmup writes are now replayed back into Gun in small batches rather than a single tight loop, reducing startup sync spikes while still waking existing Gun subscriptions on cold relays.
- Deduplicates with a `seen: Set<string>`.
- `joinedCommunities` is a `Set<string>` persisted in localStorage (`joined-communities`), then backfilled from the key vault so private invite/password joins survive refresh.
- Joined state is also synced from stored community encryption keys, so invite/password-joined private communities behave like normal joined communities after refresh.
- Encrypted communities are decrypted before surfacing when the user already has access, so joined private communities show their real names/descriptions instead of the public placeholder metadata.
- `joinCommunity()` is optimistic locally for normal joins, but first checks existing key-vault access and short-circuits without incrementing member counts when the user already holds the private-community key.

## `postStore.ts` — `usePostStore`

- Similar structure to `pollStore`: map-based, per-community subscriptions, pagination.
- Uses per-community initial-load tracking (`communityInitialLoadDone`) plus subscription timestamps to avoid false "new post" banners from startup hydration.
- `pendingNewPosts` is banner-only state; accepted posts live in `postsMap` and seen IDs are persisted (`seen-post-ids`) so accepted content survives refresh.
- `createPost()` checks the current user's `showRealName` preference. If false (default), generates a pseudonym from the pre-generated postId + authorId as the `authorName`. If true, uses the user's `customUsername`.
- `loadMorePosts()` still paginates by `PAGE_SIZE` (10), but Home feed now controls initial visibility separately (up to 50 items) so users do not need an initial scroll to reveal already-fetched content.
- Debug instrumentation logs `[PostStoreDebug]` entries for community subscription start/initial completion, injected posts, and visible-count changes to help diagnose feed hydration issues (enabled only when `localStorage.interpoll_post_debug === 'true'`).

## `commentStore.ts` — `useCommentStore`

- Loads and caches comments keyed by post ID.
- `createComment()` checks the current user's `showRealName` preference. Same pseudonym-vs-real-name logic as posts.

## `userStore.ts` — `useUserStore`

- Simple profile cache: `profiles: Record<string, UserProfile>`. Fetches from `UserService` on miss.
- `getCachedKarma(userId)` — used by `useModerationFilter` to hide low-karma content without a network fetch.

## `chatRoomStore.ts` — `useChatRoomStore`

Manages encrypted chat rooms via `ChatRoomService`.

- **Room lifecycle**: `loadRooms()` fetches joined rooms, `createRoom()` / `joinRoom()` add to the list, `leaveRoom()` removes.
- **Live messaging**: `enterRoom(room)` subscribes to incoming messages via `ChatRoomService.subscribeToMessages`; `leaveCurrentRoom()` unsubscribes and clears state.
- **Deduplication**: Both `enterRoom` and `sendMessage` guard against duplicate message IDs before pushing.

## `syncStore.ts`

Currently empty/placeholder.
